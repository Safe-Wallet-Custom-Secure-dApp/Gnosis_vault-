	‚Ä¢	Mandatory 2FA for all enterprise members
	‚Ä¢	Secure 2FA methods only (authenticator apps, security keys, passkeys)

	‚Ä¢	Immutable audit trails for every transaction

üß† Philosophy:

We‚Äôre not here to LARP security‚Äîwe enforce it. Every commit, transaction, and permission is intentional. This isn‚Äôt just DevOps meets DeFi‚Äîit‚Äôs the next generation of programmable, defensible capital management. If the Gnosis Vault had a motto, it‚Äôd be:

‚ÄúBuild fast, move safe
